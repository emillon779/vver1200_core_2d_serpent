# VVER-1200 Assembly Comparison

This README describes the comparison of VVER-1200 nuclear reactor assembly simulations using Serpent and OpenMC.

## Overview

We conducted a comparison of the VVER-1200 assembly using two neutron transport codes: Serpent and OpenMC. The aim was to evaluate the consistency and performance of both tools in simulating the reactor assembly.
## Keywords
